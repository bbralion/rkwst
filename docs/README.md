# RKWST APIs
RKWST provides two publicly available APIs - the http-based REST API and the asynchronous Websocket API.
Currently their functionality differs quite a bit and, as of right now, the WS API is intended only for
subscribing to receive updates regarding a request net.

## REST API
Defined in [http-api.yml](./http-api.yml) and can be viewed online on [Stoplight](https://renbou.stoplight.io/docs/rkwst).

## Websocket API
Defined in [ws-api.yml](./ws-api.yml) and can be viewed online by pasting it to [AsyncAPI Studio](https://studio.asyncapi.com/).
